# WinstonLutzPylinac_SHIFT
Improved Pylinac Winston Lutz test based on EPID images. 
The code performs analysis at ideal isocenter point, virtually applying the necessary shift.

The system uses IEC 61217 coordinate space. 
The images need to be adquired in an EPID system (DICOM format). 

*Requirements: Install Pylinac 3.0 (https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/installation.html)
